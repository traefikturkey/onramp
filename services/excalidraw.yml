# Keep in mind this version does not implement the sharable links
# or real time collaborative sessions as stated on their docker hub page
# https://hub.docker.com/r/excalidraw/excalidraw
# Look at this for that https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions/3879

# It also does not seem to feature saving of drawings,
# so be careful with that and remember to save your drawings before refreshing or leaving
