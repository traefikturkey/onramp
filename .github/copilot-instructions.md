- Do **not** create new files unless the user explicitly requests the file by name or clearly authorizes the creation.
- If the user asks for a new file but does not specify a name, use your best judgment to name the file appropriately.
- If a task appears to require a new file but no explicit approval is given, pause, summarize the need, and ask the user for confirmation.
- When file creation is declined or unclear, offer alternative approaches that reuse existing files whenever possible.
