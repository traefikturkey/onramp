Workflow files can be managed on the local filesystem at:
  ./media/n8n/workflows/

Commands:
  make n8n-export-workflows    Export all workflows to filesystem
  make n8n-import-workflows    Import workflows from filesystem (requires restart)
  make n8n-export-credentials  Export credentials (encrypted)
  make n8n-import-credentials  Import credentials (requires restart)

Note: Credentials are encrypted with N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY. To make them
portable between instances, set the same key in both environments.

Access the web UI at https://n8n.${HOST_DOMAIN}
