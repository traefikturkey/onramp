Semaphore has been enabled with a dedicated MySQL 8.0 database.

Due to known upstream migration issues with MariaDB, the semaphore-dedicated-mysql
override has been automatically enabled.

Default credentials:
  Username: admin@localhost
  Password: changeme

IMPORTANT: Change the admin password after first login!
