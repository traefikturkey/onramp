After first start, initialize the vault:

1. Initialize vault (generates unseal keys and root token):
   docker exec -it vault vault operator init

2. SAVE THE KEYS SECURELY - you cannot recover them later!

3. Unseal the vault (requires 3 of 5 keys by default):
   docker exec -it vault vault operator unseal
